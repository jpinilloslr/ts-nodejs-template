# Node.js template

This is a Node.js template with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier integration to help you kickstart your projects with compilation-time type checking, consistent code styling, and code linting.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (with npm)
- Your preferred text editor or IDE with TypeScript support

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpinilloslr/ts-nodejs-template.git
cd ts-nodejs-template
npm install
```

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for your convenience:

- **build**: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the "dist" folder.
- **watch**: Automatically recompiles whenever changes are made to the source code.
- **lint**: Lints your code using ESLint to identify and fix issues.
- **prebuild**: Runs ESLint to check for linting issues before compilation.

Feel free to modify the content to start building your Node.js application.

## Code Formatting

Prettier is integrated into the project to ensure consistent code formatting. Your code will be automatically formatted whenever you save a file. To configure Prettier settings, check the .prettierrc file in the project root.

## Code Linting

ESLint is set up to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues in your code. The ESLint rules are defined in the .eslintrc file. Make sure to follow the linting recommendations to maintain code quality.
